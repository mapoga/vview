## üì¶ Installation

### Download
Download the zip file of this project and unpack it somewhere. ex: `C:\Users\my_user\.nuke\mapoga\vview`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This package cannot be placed directly inside `.nuke`.
> It must be placed in a folder that is not part of nuke's plugin path.
> Here the `mapoga` folder is used to shield **vview** from being directly imported.

**or**

Use one of the commands:
```shell
# Linux / Macos
git clone https://github.com/mapoga/vview ~/.nuke/mapoga/vview

# Windows PowerShell
git clone https://github.com/mapoga/vview ~\.nuke\mapoga\vview

# Windows Command Prompt
git clone https://github.com/mapoga/vview %USERPROFILE%\.nuke\mapoga\vview
```



### Configure

Add this line somewhere in your `init.py` file.
```python
nuke.pluginAddPath(r"mapoga\vview\src")
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Adjust the path to your own install. Take note that the path is pointing inside `vview\src`.

Add this snippet somewhere in your `menu.py` file. Feel free to change the shortcut to your liking.
```python
import vview
nuke.menu('Nuke').findItem('Edit/Node/Filename').addCommand("vview", vview.launch, shortcut="Ctrl+Up")
```

> [!TIP]
> If the `.nuke/init.py` and `.nuke/menu.py` files did not already exist you need to create them.


## üöÄ Usage
1. Select **Read** node(s).
2. Press the shortcut keys `Ctrl + Up` and **vview** will appear.
3. If you have multiple **Read** nodes selected, the first one with a valid path will be displayed.
4. Change version using the **arrow keys**. If preview mode is active, the nodes will be updated interactively.
5. Press `Enter` to apply the change. The version change will apply to all selected nodes. Each node will have its frame-range scanned/updated individually.
6. Alternatively, press `Escape` to cancel.
